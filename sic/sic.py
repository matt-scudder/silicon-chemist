This is the command-line interface for SiC続. It takes as input the same options as the
old SiC, and produces similar output on request.

This interface is provided purely for creating similar functionality to the old SiC
and inter-language cooperation; if other Python programs wish to use the functionality
of SiC続, they can import the libraries used here to produce results.

As of now, this program only calls the old SiC's command-line arguments.

	Parses SiC-format file and returns an object with reactants, solvent and products.

	SiC format is defined by the following pattern:

	{reactants}>>{solvent}>>{products}

	With delimiters between each reactant or product being arbitrary, SO LONG AS
	the same delimiter is used between each reactant, product or solvent.
	Characters that CANNOT be used as delimiters are SMILES characters such as =, #,
	[,], etc. (see SMILES format guide at http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html ).

	SiC-format files describe a SINGLE reaction on a SINGLE line. Unlike the original SiC, this program
	does not require a ; character to terminate the line, only EOF or \n; any characters after the last
	SMILES string will be parsed out.

	This function Separates out reactants by taking in all the characters before the first >,
	solvent by taking in any characters found after the first two > in the string,
	and products by taking in all the characters after the last >.
