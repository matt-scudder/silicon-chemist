While the sources and sinks "modules" contain the actual expressions used
for matching, this module contains the logic used to actually perform the
matching on a molecule and generate the data structures other parts of SiCÂ³

    Segments a molecule into sets of sources and sinks by iterating over all
    source and sink molecular regular expressions this program knows about,
    and creating a data structure that "tags" atoms by their source and sink
    characteristics.

    Returns an object with two properties:

    - sources: List of all sources in the molecule
    - sinks: List of all sinks in the molecule

    Each of these two lists will consist of objects that have the following properties:

    - "subtype" : Type of generic source or sink the object represents, such as "Y-L" or "Y=C-L"
    - "atoms" : An object which has keys for each of the "pieces" of the source/sink,
        and a dict for the actual atom, which has both the atom itself, and its corresponding molecule.
        The last bit exists because Atom objects aren't "real" in that they are generated from scratch
        every time you access a Molecule's atoms.
